# lab_2_repo assessment

## 1) My Time Comparison

For my lab assignment I decided to compare two different events in time rather than location. my area of focus is on the United States and I decided to compare tweets from April 19th and April 20th. My reason for choosing to compare different points in time was to see if my results would change along different days(A 24 hour difference), I wanted to find out if topics change based on whatever is popular that day or if certain words stay the same. I predicted that there would be a significant change in topics as I saw many posts on Twitter talking about the 4/20 holiday and many users planning to hang out with friends to smoke marijuana on April 20th which would create a larger shift in what words would be used.

## 2) Comparing My Maps

For my first map I gathered tweets from April 19th, and mapped the coordinates of the tweets onto QGIS and exported my results:
![Map 1](/img/Lab_2_pt_1.png)

As well as my second map where I gathered tweets from Aprin 20th
![Map 2](/img/Lab_2_pt_2.png)

Comparing both of these maps, I see a trend in large cities holding a higher concentration of users and the middle of the US being more empty than the coasts. A main difference I found from the two maps is that the second one has more tweets spread out from the larger cities than the first map, and there are more users within the central US than before.

## 3) Comparing My Wordclouds

Finally I exported the text for both my geotweets files into a wordcloup application and generated an image that represents the most commonly used words for that day, included below are the images for both April 19th and April 20th:
![April 19 wordcloud](/img/Word_Art_1.png)
![April 20 wordcloud](/img/Word_Art_2.png)

From looking at both images there are some similarities and differences that I have noticed, some of the similarities I found are that many of the words are positive, I expected there to be more negative or vulgar words (which can be found but are tiny in comparison). I hoped that the time difference and events would play a significant role in creating unique wordclouds but the similarities show that there is some consistancy in twitter conversations between different days with some minor changes. The second map seemed to be more positive to me, which may have been attributed to people being more calm on that day.
