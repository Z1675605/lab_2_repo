# lab_2_repo assessment

## 1) My Time Comparison

For my lab assignment I decided to compare two different events in time rather than location. my area of focus is on the United States and I decided to compare tweets from April 19th and April 20th. My reason for choosing to compare different points in time was to see if my results would change along different days(A 24 hour difference), I wanted to find out if topics change based on whatever is popular that day or if certain words stay the same.

## 2) Comparing My Maps

For my first map I gathered tweets from April 19th, and mapped the coordinates of the tweets onto QGIS and exported my results:
